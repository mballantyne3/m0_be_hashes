# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I had a really hard time with the last question in hashes_2.rb. It took me multiple attempts to integrate my 'if statement' into the each command. I kept doubting whether just typing out the word "friend" would actually give me any data without the #{}
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
I will take down notes primarily on really technical commands that I want to quickly reference. I've noticed I've been slowing down on putting them in my notebook however, because even the simple commands I try to recall, I seem to have forgotten to write down.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I use Google to give me an example of the problem I'm trying to solve. I think I first did this with converting the email array into a hash just to give me an idea of where to start. I wouldn't say I use it a ton, but for the more technical questions requiring multiple commands in several lines of code I use Google to give me some direction.
